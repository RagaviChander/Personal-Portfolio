								<div class="image main"><img src="images/background.png" alt="background" /></div>
								<h2>Background</h2>
									<blockquote><span class="image left"><img src="images/back.png" alt="back" /></span>I'm from Des Moines, born and raised. Iowa is where I've spent my whole life, and I adore everything about itâ€”the scenery, the culture, and the people. Des Moines is my home base, but Iowa City, where I went to school, also holds a special place in my heart. Growing up surrounded by family and the welcoming atmosphere of these cities, I've found opportunities that have truly shaped who I am.</blockquote>
								<br>
									<h2>Family Life</h2>
									<blockquote><span class="image right"><img src="images/family.png" alt="family" /></span>I come from a tight-knit household of four, where I'm the youngest. My bond with my older sister is incredibly strong, and we both share the pride of graduating from the University of Iowa. Our family cherishes our Indian heritage, which we actively learn about and celebrate together. Periodically, we embark on trips to India to connect with our extended family, enriching our cultural roots even further.</blockquote>
								<h2>Education</h2>
									<blockquote><span class="image left"><img src="images/school.png" alt="school" /></span>I am a soon to be graduate from the University of Iowa. Studying Marketing and Business Analytics in the Tippie College of Business with a Minor in Psychology. I also got the honor to study abroad through the CIMBA program in Italy where I got to learn marketing and finance from professors across the nation.
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									</blockquote>
								<h2>Occupation</h2>
									<blockquote><span class="image right"><img src="images/job.png" alt="job" /></span>I am delighted to have had the opportunity to join the Des Moines PepsiCo team last summer as a sales management intern. Over the course of the 10-week program, I gained a comprehensive understanding of all PBNA functions and had the chance to work on an individual project aimed at addressing a specific problem area within the company. Now, I am excited to announce that I will be returning to PepsiCo as a full-time Sales Management Associate at the Des Moines office. I look forward to continuing my career journey with Pepsi and contributing to the company's success.
									<br>
									Throughout college, I got to work as a campus manager for freshprints to manage and coordinate custom merchandise for student organizations across campus. I also got the represent the University of Iowa as a social media manager to showcase and represent our University. 
									</blockquote>
								<h2>Experience</h2>
								<blockquote><span class="image right"><img src="images/cimba.jpg" alt="cimba" /></span>As stated before, through the Tippie College of Business, I had an amazing opportunity to travel to Poderno Del Grappa, Italy, a small town next to venice to extend my studies over the 2023 summer. I got to take marketing and finance classes over an accelerted period of time while also experiencing the culture that surrounds the landscape of italy and educate myself about the history that its soil still carries. This oppurtunity is one I will remember for years to come and truly feel honored to have taken part in. </blockquote>

										<p>To kickstart my Marketing studies, I took part in a project as the company P&G to rejuvenate their popular product, the Gillete Razor. As a team of five, we created "The Lazor" as a long term, electric razor that permanently removes mens hair to reduce wasteage and frequency of purchase for a one time higher price. This creative project was exciting to take part in and try product design!</p>
